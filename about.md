    My journey in software development has been diverse and rewarding. I’ve honed my skills across various technologies, including Python, JavaScript, Kotlin, Java, Golang, PHP, and C#/.Net. Whether it’s building efficient APIs, architecting cloud infrastructure, or optimizing database performance, I thrive on the challenges that backend development presents.

    Away from the screen, I find joy in the timeless melodies of classic rock and the serenity of exploring nature trails. And of course, there’s nothing quite like savoring the simple pleasures of a delicious pizza.
