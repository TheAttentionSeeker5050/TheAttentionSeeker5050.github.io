<p id="heading-p">This website project serves as a centralized hub containing links to all my live projects and social media profiles, offering visitors a comprehensive overview of my work and online presence.</p>

## Overview:
Designed as a dashboard-style interface, my Personal Front Site is your gateway to exploring all my live projects and connecting with me across various social media platforms. Developed using Flask and MongoDB, this platform showcases my proficiency in web development and database management. The links and data is fed from the Mongo Atlas Instance, and rendered using Flask Jinja2 Templates. At the same time, custom link names and icon file are declared as document fields in the database on each link so they can have a more personalised look. For the moment all project links have a compass, but if I want, they can have a different icon file.

## Features:
- **Project Links:** Access links to all my live projects, allowing you to explore them in real-time.
- **Social Media Integration:** Connect with me on various social media platforms, facilitating ongoing engagement and communication.
- **Dashboard Interface:** Navigate effortlessly through the dashboard-style interface, designed for intuitive and seamless user experience.
- **Dynamic Content:** Experience dynamic content updates, ensuring that youâ€™re always up-to-date with my latest projects and social media activity.
